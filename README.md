# BMap

>This was created to provide backend to the project [BMap-UI](https://github.com/asutoshpalai/Bmap-UI).


>Both of these projects were developed during a 24-hour hackathon organised by Microsoft - code.fun.do

The aim of this project was to locate your friends on your college MAP.
It follows a friend-request model to judge a user as whether he is a friend or not and gives the location depending on the basis of the privacy settings of the user.

We also know it by the name Marauder's Map as it serves a similar purpose.
